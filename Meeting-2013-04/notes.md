# Open Discussion

Cobra programming language: http://cobra-language.com/ A vaguely Python-esque language that incorporates both static and dynamic language capabilities. Ted wrote an article on Cobra for MSDN Magazine a while ago: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/dd882513.aspx

PLT Games: http://www.pltgames.com/ A build-a-language-a-month contest game. We were kind of intrigued by this and thought maybe this would be an interesting exercise for the group to engage in sometime.

Opa: http://opalang.org/ A functional strongly-typed/type-inferenced language/platform compiling to JavaScript on both client and server for providing an all-in-one Web development experience. We talked about possibly doing a "learn as a group" exercise around this sometime.

As is common for groups studying languages including functional langauges, monads came up. Eric Lippert's series on monads (http://ericlippert.com/category/monads/) was mentioned. There may be some value in the group studying this collectively, a la a study group or something.

Some of us expressed interest in Vancouver PolyglotConf: http://polyglotconf.com/

There was some discussion around Clojure, and one of us (Chris?) mentioned 4Clojure, a series of programming katas/koans for Clojurists in particular: http://www.4clojure.com/

Discussion of Clojure also brought up LightTable (http://www.lighttable.com/), a Clojure IDE written in Clojure and ClojureScript. This also brought up discussions of "IDE-as-value"/"IDE-as-data", as expressed on LightTable's creator's blog: http://www.chris-granger.com/2013/01/24/the-ide-as-data/

There was some discussion about the ubiquitous program-the-combat-robot games a la http://robocode.sourceforge.net/ . We briefly discussed how we might look into building one across a variety of platforms and languages, so that we can finally decide which language is the One Language to Rule Them All.

We created the SeaLang organization on GitHub, and created this repo within it. Ted is the current owner of it. Send email to him with your GitHub ID so he can add you to the organization, or add yourself if you can. (Or tell Ted how to enable the organization to accept new participants so everybody can have access to the repos we create, and he'll do that.) We agreed that this would be a cool way to capture meeting notes, and an easy way for all of us to see new repos created for any code-a-thons/hack-a-thons/coding dojos/whatever the group ends up creating. We may investigate converting this site over to GitHubPages at some point, if we get organized enough. :-)

We talked briefly about the intersection of TFS/Git. http://tfs.visualstudio.com/

While talking about Git's strengths and weaknesses, Veracity, another DVCS, was mentioned, and some of its pros/cons (pre-commit/post-commit hooks written in JavaScript, for example) were discussed. http://veracity-scm.com/

The ridiculously simply static HTML hosting startup Site44 (http://www.site44.com) and its server-side programmatic support through WebScript.io (https://www.webscript.io/), which uses Lua, came up.

The ICFP 2006 programming contest came up. http://boundvariable.org/task.shtml This sounds like it would be an awesome exercise for a group coding dojo exercise sometime. Luke Hoban's solution in F# and Silverlight was mentioned, but it appears like the implementation has since disappeared from the interwebz.

Meeting adjourned @ 9pm. Much thanks to Patrick, from Greythorn (URL?) for buying the beer.
