Meetings
========

The Seattle Languages group (http://www.meetup.com/SeaLang) is intended as a user group for people who like programming languages--using them, exploring them, building them, comparing them, dissecting them, and in general geeking out around them. Some of the languages that could/are included in this list are C, C++, Java, C#, Scala, Clojure, F#, Ruby (native, IronRuby and/or JRuby), Python (native, IronPython or Jython), JavaScript, Groovy, Kotlin, Haskell, Erlang, Go, Dart, D, and the list goes on and on.

This repository is (at least initially) intended as a repository for us to capture meeting notes (including interesting URLs and stuff) for the various meetings. Slide decks will probably appear in here as well, along with demos or other binaries, if and when speakers come to the meetings.

http://www.meetup.com/SeaLang has the meeting details (and we would prefer if you would RSVP through that if you're planning to come), but if you're too busy or lazy to look 'em up, we meet the first Wednesday of the month at Canyon's in Redmond, WA.
